# Flappy Bird clone

## Description
So flappy bird... In my case, it's rather flappy cat.. ));

This is my educational project. It's based mostly on series of videos from YouTube channel [TheChernoProject](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject):
- [OpenGL series](https://thecherno.com/opengl),
- [Let's Make Flappy Bird! (LWJGL 3 / OpenGL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=527bR2JHSR0). 

The original source code in Java can be found [here](https://github.com/TheCherno/Flappy).

There are also some minor game mechanics changes inspired by this video:
- [CS50's Introduction to Game Development - Lecture 1 - Flappy Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IdOCxHGMIo&t=3651s).

I took the background image for this game from [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/roulettesplay/art/Pixel-Wallpaper-519521478) and cropped it a bit. [Here the link for artist page](https://www.deviantart.com/roulettesplay).
